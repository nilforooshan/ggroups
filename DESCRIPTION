Description: Calculates additive and dominance genetic relationship matrices and their inverses, in matrix and tabular-sparse formats. It includes functions for checking and processing pedigree, calculating inbreeding coefficients (Meuwissen & Luo, 1992 <doi:10.1186/1297-9686-24-4-305>), as well as functions to calculate the matrix of genetic group contributions (Q), and adding those contributions to the genetic merit of animals (Quaas (1988) <doi:10.3168/jds.S0022-0302(88)79691-5>). Calculation of Q is computationally extensive. There are computationally optimized functions to calculate Q.
